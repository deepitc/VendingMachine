# VendingMachine

The Vending Machine project simulates the operation of a vending machine that sells cans of soda. 
The program uses composition to create objects using reusable code and practices reading from a file and handling exceptions. 
The Vending Machine is made up of several components, including a coin box for depositing coins, a bill box for accepting one-dollar bills, inventory information for tracking beverage brands, and a display for communicating with the user. 
The user inserts coins and bills until the amount deposited equals the cost of the desired soda, and the vending machine either dispenses the soda or provides change.
